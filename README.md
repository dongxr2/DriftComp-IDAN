# DriftComp-IDAN

This repository is associated with the paper titled "Real-Time Correction and Long-Term Drift Compensation in MOS Gas Sensor Arrays Using Iterative Random Forests and Incremental Domain-Adversarial Networks". The paper presents a novel framework for real-time data error correction and long-term drift com-pensation utilizing an iterative random forest-based error correction algorithm paired with an Incremental Domain-Adversarial Network (IDAN).

The complete source code and dataset used in the experiments will be made publicly available upon the paper's acceptance.
