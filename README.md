# DriftComp-IDAN

This repository is associated with the paper titled "Real-Time Data Error Correction and Prediction with Online Learning for Long-Term Drift Compensation in Sensor Arrays". The paper presents a novel framework for real-time data error correction and long-term drift com-pensation utilizing an iterative random forest-based error correction algorithm paired with an Incremental Domain-Adversarial Network (IDAN).

The complete source code and dataset used in the experiments will be made publicly available upon the paper's acceptance.
